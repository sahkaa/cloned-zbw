# Zero-Based sample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The default build is for on production mode.

Notes:
* The TeamCity build will automatically run: `npm run lint`, `npm run test-coverage` and `npm run build` so it is recommended to double check them locally first.
* The TSLint rule `"lines-between-class-members": true`, doesn't work if the line break marker used is CRLF.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
To calculate the test coverage you can use `npm run test-coverage` and the result will be shown on the coverage folder created.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
